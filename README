WHAT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dynamic DNS for people who have common sense.
Run it from somewhere, it will fetch its own IP and submit a DNS record update
to whatever provider you want (as long as it is supported).


HOW
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
APIs, mostly.
I will mantain support for Gandi since that's what I use, maybe I'll do OVH in
the future.


WHY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- I have my own home server
- My ISP doesn't like static IPs
- I hate dyndns
- I own 102083.4 domain names
- I wanted something that I could run on 9front
